= Supported Backends

NeoEMF is designed to be easily extensible with new backends.
The current version of the framework embeds three implementations that are optimized for specific modeling operations.

NeoEMF currently supports these different backends:

* *MapDB*: relies on http://www.mapdb.org[MapDB] on-disk maps to store model elements.
This backend has been designed to provide fast access to atomic operations, such as accessing a single element/attribute and navigating a single reference.
This implementation is optimized for EMF API-based accesses which typically generates this kind of atomic and fragmented queries calls on the model.

*WARNING:* MapDB can be very slow on Windows (see https://github.com/jankotek/mapdb/issues/789[jankotek/mapdb#789] for more information)

* *BerkeleyDB*: relies on http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/database-technologies/berkeleydb/overview[BerkeleyDB] on-disk maps to store model elements.
Very similar to MapDB.
* *Blueprints*: relies on the https://github.com/tinkerpop/blueprints/wiki[Tinkerpop Blueprints] to access graph databases.
The current implementation embeds a Neo4j wrapper for convenience purposes, but Blueprints also allows to access any NoSQL database implementing the Tinkerpop stack, such as http://orientdb.com[OrientDB] or http://titan.thinkaurelius.com[Titan].
This backend has been designed to benefit from the rich traversal features that graph databases provide, such as fast shortest-path computation, or efficient processing of complex navigation paths.
These advanced query capabilities have been used in the https://github.com/atlanmod/Mogwai[Mogwa√Ø] tool that maps OCL expressions to graph traversals.
* *HBase*: relies on the distributed nature of the column-based datastore to enable the development of distributed MDE-based applications.
In contrast with the previous implementations, the https://hbase.apache.org[HBase] backend offers concurrent read/write capabilities and guarantees ACID properties at model element level.
It exploits the wide availability of distributed clusters in order to distribute intensive read/write workloads across datanodes.
The distributed nature of this persistence solution is used in the https://github.com/atlanmod/org.eclipse.atl.atlMR[ATL-MR] tool, a distributed engine for model transformations in the ATL language on top of MapReduce.
