= Architecture

== Development View

NeoEMF follows Apache Maven's conventions.

Except for some specific artifacts, such as Eclipse plugins,
the project follows the Apache Maven's https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-the-standard-directory-layout.html[Standard Directory Layout].

All software dependencies are declared in the Project Object Model (pom.xml file).
Object Models (from all modules) use a `dependencyManagement` to manage the dependencies,
and use `properties` to manage the dependencies version.

=== Package Organization

Packages keep together classes that implement a same feature.
We organize packages by features, rather than layers or structure.
Read this http://www.javapractices.com/topic/TopicAction.do?Id=205[article] for more information.

Avoid packages named `beans`, `exceptions`, `factories`, or `collections`.
