<h1>NeoEMF : A Multi-Database Model Persistence Framework.</h1>
<div>
    <p>
        The figure below describes the integration of NeoEMF in the <a href="https://eclipse.org/modeling/emf/">Eclipse
        Modeling Framework (EMF)</a> ecosystem, the most popular modeling framework nowadays.

    <h3>EMF Behavior</h3>
    <p>
        Modelers typically access a model using <i>Model-based Tools</i>, which provide high-level modeling features
        such as a graphical interface, interactive console, or query editor.

        These features internally rely on EMF's <i>Model Access API</i> to navigate models, perform CRUD operations,
        check constraints, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
        At its core, EMF delegates the operations to a persistence manager using its <i>Persistence API</i>, which is in
        charge of the (de)serialization of the model.
    </p>

    <h3>NeoEMF Behavior</h3>
    <p>
        The NeoEMF <i>core</i> component is defined at this level, and can be registered as a persistence manager for
        EMF, replacing, for instance, the default XMI persistence manager.
        This design makes NeoEMF both transparent to the client-application and EMF itself, that simply delegates the
        calls without taking care of the actual storage.
    </p>
    <p>
        Once the NeoEMF <i>core</i> component has received the request of the modeling operation to perform, it forwards
        the operation to the appropriate database driver (<i>MapDB</i>, <i>Blueprints</i>, or <i>HBase</i>), which is in
        charge of handling the low-level representation of the model.
        These connectors translate modeling operations into <i>Backend API</i> calls, store the results, and reify
        database records into EMF <i>EObjects</i> when needed.
    </p>
    <p>
        NeoEMF also embeds a set of default caching strategies that are used to improve performance of client
        applications, and can be configured transparently at the EMF API level.
    </p>
    <p>
        Each backend is provided in a dedicated Eclipse plugin. you can navigate through the documentation to have a
        complete overview of backend-specific classes and how they interact with the <i>core</i> component.
    </p>

    <h4>Provided Adapters</h4>
    <p>
        NeoEMF provides 5 database adapters for now:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Blueprints
            <ul>
                <li><b>TinkerGraph</b>: The default graph database</li>
                <li><b>Neo4j</b>: A graph-based database</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>BerkeleyDB</b>: A map-based database</li>
        <li><b>MapDB</b>: Another map-based database</li>
        <li><b>HBase</b>: A distributed column-based database</li>
    </ul>
